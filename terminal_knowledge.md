Which terminal client did you choose? Why?

I choose zsh + iterm2 because I am using Mac and its default terminal, which is based on zsh so I am pretty familiar with zsh.

What customizations (if any) did you make?

I don't make any customizations because the default one looks good to me

What was the most useful command you learned today?

It's more like a review for me:
pwd: Print the current working directory.
cd ..: move to upper level
cd ~ : move to home 
mkdir <directory_name>: Create a new directory.
mv <source> <destination>: Move files or directories.
rm <file_name>: delete a file.
cat <file_name>: Display the contents of a file
chmod <permissions> <file_name>: Change the permissions of a file or directory.(learn before, but feel like won't use a lot)
