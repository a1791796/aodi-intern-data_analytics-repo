What was your first impression of the app?
an clean design app mainly with white and orange. Easy to use and understand when I first use.

Did you find anything difficult to understand?
No really. The function is easy to set up.

If you had to explain Focus Bear to a friend in one sentence, what would you say?
A powerful and easy tool to help you focus and break effectively 

What are some changes that could improve the new user experience?
When  I click on the pop up page such as prefereneces, start Focus session or Pause blocking. 
I am not able to minimize the window to the dock. So if I need to check on something when I have these
pages open, they will always on the first layer/level. (I am using MAC)
And another thing come to my mind is, is it possible to make a version that can be used without internet,
because I notice all the break video is from Youtube, maybe can use mp4 rather than link it to Youtube.
This offline version can be designed for people who do their work without internet.
