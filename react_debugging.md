Use breakpoints in your code (either through VS Code or through browser developer tools like Chrome DevTools) to pause execution at specific lines.
Use error boundaries in React to catch runtime errors in specific components and prevent the entire app from crashing.
Use tools like Chrome DevTools or React Profiler to identify performance optimize code.

React DevTools is the most essential tool for debugging React apps.You can easily identify which components are being rendered, inspect their state and props
React Profiler helps identify performance bottlenecks by tracking which components are taking a long time to render, and then modify your code to improve the render time.
Error Boundaries prevent runtime errors from breaking the whole React app. 

 In large codebases, understanding how components are structured and how they interact with with React Devtools, 
 and then Error Boundaries prevent errors that can easily cause the whole app to crash. After clean all the errors,
 use React Profiler helps you identify components that are slow.
