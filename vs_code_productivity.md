navigation:
cmd+F: find the word
cmd+P: go to file
fn+F12: jump to function, list, dict.


Editing:
cmd+w: close file
cmd+D: select all occurrences of a word
cmd+R(I rebind the keyborad): find and replace the word
cmd+A: select all
Option + Click: Multiple Cursors to code Simultaneously
select the code and then shift+enter: run this line

terminal
option+~ : open new terminal
comand+\: split terminal 

I think all these shortcuts are very useful in my daily work.

With keyboard shortcuts I can:
- Speed up task execution
- Efficient navigation
- Faster editing with less mouse movement
