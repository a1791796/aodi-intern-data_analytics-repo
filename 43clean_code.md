Why is breaking down functions beneficial?

Smaller functions are easier to read and understand. When you break down complex tasks into smaller,
manageable functions, each function tends to do one thing. And smaller,functions are easier to reuse across the codebase. 
Also with small function, it's easier to find errors. If a bug arises in a small function, you know exactly where to look.
Each function can be tested independently with various inputs to ensure it works as expected, avoid creating a whole chuck of bug.

How did refactoring improve the structure of the code?

During refactoring, we can simplify complex, long code into smaller, more understandable function, also reduce the code redundancy.
We can do some formatting to improve the structure such as consistent name in variables, better abstractions for reuse later.
