What does git bisect do?

When there is a bug in your commit, git biset can find the first bug commit.

When would you use it in a real-world debugging situation?

would use git bisect when a bug appears, and don't know which commit caused it. 
Plus the project has many commits, making it too slow to check manually.The bug isnâ€™t obvious from looking at code changes. 

How does it compare to manually reviewing commits?

it is fast (binary search) and finds the exact commit.
