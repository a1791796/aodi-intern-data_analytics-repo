What do you hope to learn from this internship?


- how to work with people with different culture (only work in a Uni project before, don't know if there will be any difference)
- experience the Australian working environment
- get familiar with the real data analytics job

What skills are you most excited to develop?

- use of some specific data analytics tools that I haven't use before.
- balance work and life
- time management

What do you think you can contribute to the team?


I can use my experience on R, SQL and Python to help, even though I know what I learn it's no enough for this internship,
so I will learn whatever I need in the internship. And I think my foundation on coding and data analytics will be useful.
And I can also give opinion base on my knowledge

What is one area you feel less confident in that youâ€™d like to improve?

The area I feel less confident is presenting in front of others. I feel anxious and shy when I talk in front of lots of people

What does success in this internship look like for you?
- I learn and finish the required jobs for me
- Being praised by others on work
