How does SQL help in data analysis?

SQL allows analysts to retrieve data from one or more tables using queries.
SQL enables filtering data using the WHERE clause, which allows analysts to focus on relevant subsets of data.
SQL’s aggregation functions like SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(), MIN(), and MAX() help analysts summarize large datasets and get meaningful insights from them.
Using the GROUP BY clause, SQL allows data to be grouped based on one or more columns, making it easier to analyze trends and other special information.
QL’s JOIN operations allow analysts to combine data from multiple tables, based on same keys.
SQL provides the ORDER BY clause to sort data in ascending or descending order, making it easier to identify trends.
The CASE statement in SQL allows for conditional transformations of data.

What is the difference between filtering (WHERE) and aggregation (GROUP BY)?

where WHERE filters the rows with the condition, only return rows that meet the condition.
groupby to sort the rows in the same condition together and don't drop any rows, then HAVING filters the grouped results

How would you retrieve and analyze user activity data in Focus Bear’s database?

Define the structure of the user activity data first, use SELECT statements to pull user activity data with interested condition
maybe to some aggregrate function to calculate the whole database's statistics.

Why is learning SQL important even if you primarily use Python for analytics?

Because SQL is fundamental to interacting with databases and SQL is to make queries, aggregations, and filtering operations directly on the data, rather than downloading everything and processing it in Python.
SQL is designed for handling data. We cannot analyze data without learning the fundamental technique to play with data.
