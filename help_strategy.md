When the question is really easy about the basic code I don't remember, I prefer to use AI to show me the code because it's quick and precise.
But when the question I can't solve with AI(normally complicate question), I will google it and someone will have similar question where I can get some help with.
And then with this experience, work with AI again to see whether I can handle it. 

When the above steps can't solve my problem, I will ask my colleagues for help. Because I will put colleagues as the last resort. 
Or when I facing the sensitive problem which I can't ask AI and google, I will ask them directly.

Developers may not have immediate expertise or assistance when facing complex issues.
In the absence of collaboration, developers might overlook simple problem, or vice versa. People alone can't find every bug with their own experience!
When working alone, developers may feel more pressure to resolve issues quickly, leading to rushed decisions.
