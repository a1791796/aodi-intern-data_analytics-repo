When should you add comments?
If the logic is not immediately obvious, add a brief comment explaining the reasoning.
When writing reusable functions/variables, write down their purpose, parameters, and return value.

When should you avoid comments and instead improve the code?
When the code(variables and functions) is easy and can make itself clearer(by changing name)
Comments explaining  old, unused code should be removed instead. Sometimes will keep the previous code when trying the new one to avoid new code doesn't work.
When the code is in the well-known format(loop, if else)
