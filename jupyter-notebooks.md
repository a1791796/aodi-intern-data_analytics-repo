adv: very handy. I can write python and sql code in one platform and there are also many data visualization library bulit-in I can use. I can use Markdown to explain the code inside one file. 

 In Jupyter, code can be executed in individual cells, allowing me to run and test small portions of your code in real time.
I can quickly see the results of each step and make adjustments immediately, which is particularly useful for debugging and fine-tuning.
Also Markdown function can make the file into documentation, including headings, bullet points.

markdown cells are the the special cells for your note, the whole code chunk is for the note. It's very useful to write down some notes and code comment. 

notebook is very useful to analyze the trends because it can use SQL to first input the data, then clean the data for better inplementation.
Then use the inbuilt library with python code to make plot to show the trends, then for the result, we can use markdown cell to write down what we want to show.
In total, notebook is a very handy tool in display trends
