I tried all three of them, input the same command. Ask them to give me a basic python code.
Claude impressed me the most because it gave me the function to identify whether a number is prime or factorial. And also other different functions.

I think AI tools are good at explaining some short coding, but when you input a huge chuck of code  to them. They will get confused and do the wrong thing.
And AI can be contradictory, when I type "you did the wrong thing", they will do the whole thing again and give you another result,
even though they did correctly at the first time. 

I think AI is useful when you don't know what the code want to do or you don't remember the syntax of the code. They can give you quick and precise answer.
