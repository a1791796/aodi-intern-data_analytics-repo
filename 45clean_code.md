What made the original code complex?

Not proper function name, this causes the reader to investigate the code further to understand its purpose.
When variables and functions lack meaning in their names and without the explaination context, the entire logic becomes harder to grasp.


How did refactoring improve it?

By renaming the function to give clear context about what the function is doing.
Refactoring the variables makes their roles clear.
