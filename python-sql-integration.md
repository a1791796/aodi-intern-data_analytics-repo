By querying the database directly from Python, you can fetch the data and immediately start processing or analyzing it.
For example, after retrieving data from a PostgreSQL database using psycopg,you can load it into a Pandas DataFrame and apply complex transformations,
compute statistics, or create visualizations all in one script.


psycopg2 is the older version. And psycopg has built-in asynchronous support, which psycopg2 needs additional package.

After Loading query with SQL, pandas can:
- Handling Missing Data
- Data Filtering
- Data Aggregations
- Pivoting Data


- Data Retrieval from Database Using SQL and psycopg
- Data Transformation and Analysis with Pandas
- Data Visualization with Matplotlib or Seaborn
