How could this integration be used to generate automated reports for Focus Bear?By querying the database directly from Python, you can fetch the data and immediately start processing or analyzing it.
For example, after retrieving data from a PostgreSQL database using psycopg,you can load it into a Pandas DataFrame and apply complex transformations,
compute statistics, or create visualizations all in one script.
