I installed React Developer Tools, Redux DevTools , A JSON Viewer and Lighthouse. 

I ran through these 4 extension but haven't used it. I can write down what I learn from them
React Developer Tools: used for inspecting and debugging React applications in the browser.
Redux DevTools: debugging Redux state and actions in real-time.
JSON Viewer: used for viewing and formatting JSON data in a readable format, especially when youâ€™re working with APIs that return JSON responses.
Lighthouse: Lighthouse is great for web developers who want to improve the performance and accessibility of their websites.
