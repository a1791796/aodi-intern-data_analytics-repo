What were the issues with duplicated code?
Multiple copies of the same code increase the likelihood of introducing bugs during running, after runnning the code the name may be change
then the some code doesn't work causing bug.
code with duplication is harder to scale or extend. Adding new features or modifying existing ones requires more effort,
as changes must be replicated across multiple code sections, increasing the risk of bug.
When code is duplicated, updates or bug fixes must be applied to each separately, increasing the workload of developers.

How did refactoring improve maintainability?
reduces maintenance efforts by identifying and removing duplicate code and refactoring into single, reusable functions/variables.
Refactoring organizes code into well-structured, modular units with descriptive naming conventions to enhance code readability, makes collaboration easier. 
Refactoring reduced complexity and duplication, debugging becomes more straightforward during maintainance.
