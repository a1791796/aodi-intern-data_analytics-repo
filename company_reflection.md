I think Focus Bear is created by ADHD people and people who want to help ADHD patient (I just know Jeremy got ADHD before after browsing the Focus Bear website). 
And their goal is to help people who suffer from ADHD to experience normal and easy life with the help of this app. 

Focus Bear is helping people to block distractions, boost productivity by morning/evening routines and useful break, gives notifications with Late no more function.

I think this mission is important because it can not only help ADHD people, but everyone. There are too many distractions in our daily world: phone call/message, friends and social media. People normally
cannot focus on what they need to do. I suffer from this as well, when I am doing assignment or something I really need to do now, I will find that other things will get my attention very easy. I have to 
force myself to stick to what I am doing. With the help of Focus Bear, I think I can focus more on what I need to do. And the main customers of Focus Bear, people with ADHD. They can get lots of help from it.
Apart from what I mentioned before, Focus Bear can help Eliminate Decision Fatigue with ADHD people, so they don't need to worry about what will happen next.

Align with personal values by improving our productivity. 
It encourages the incorporation of healthy habits into daily routines and guides users through activities like meditation and exercise in the morning. 
And you can choose the activities you want to do.

Yes, I feel I am easy to be distracted by other things. Focus bear can help me with this.
