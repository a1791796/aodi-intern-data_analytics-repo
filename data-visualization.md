Data visualization can simplifies complex data, transferring the plain text data to many kinds of plots to convey the information to people better. Then with the comprehesive understanding of the data,
decision-makers can do better in their jobs.

For categorical data: bar chart and pie chart would be useful
For time series data: line chart, scatter plot, heat map would be useful
For quantitative data: histogram, box plot/violin plot, scatter plot would be useful

Seaborn builds on Matplotlib and provides a more user-friendly, higher-level interface. It simplifies the process of creating complex visualizations.
While Matplotlib itself offers deep customization for almost every aspect of a plot, which is useful for complex, specialized visualizations.
In short, Seabron is easy and quick. Matplot is more complex but meticulous.

Visualizing data allows decision-makers to understand key metrics very quickly, which helps in making informed,timely decisions.
The clearer the data, the better the business strategies and actions.
