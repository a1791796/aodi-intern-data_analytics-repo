I have used github in a group assignment before, but only very basic github function. 
So I was still nerious when i know we need to use github, but after these weeks exerice with github,
I feel more confident on using github.

I use both, depends on what I need to do. When just writing text file, I prefer using github desktop
while doing coding, I will use vscode. 

The most interesting and confusing feature to me is the pull thing. I know I don't need to pull every file to the main until today,
It depends on what type of structure you want to make, the pull function will make the branch and main having the same files. 
I spent lots of time on figuring out this problem.
