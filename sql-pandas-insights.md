SQL allows us to query and filter data directly in the database, which can be especially useful for large datasets.
After extracting data with SQL, Pandas can help clean and transform that data into a more readable format.
Then analytics may do some aggregations, conditional transformations, or complex mathematical operations for further study.
SQL can also join the modified data to oringal database.
