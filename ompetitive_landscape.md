Focus Bear is design for ADHD users, so some features aim to help them. The special break session, you can choose to do meditation or exercise and so on. 

The features that stand out is 
- Focus Bear is design for ADHD patients to help them live better
- The special break session, you can design your own, meditation or exercise. really surprised when jemery show me the first time.

- freedom can block the internet, Focus Bear is like creating a white list(from the feature video), while freedom is black list. freedom can schedule a time session to focus.
- Cold Turkey can block youtube channel, specific URLs and keywords on searching google, a more precise link blocking.
- tiimo has a to-do list function and the additional Widgets, mainly focus on planning.
- just help people do things routnely to form a healthy life style.

I think Focus Bear can add the widget function, which is very handy and not too complicated for ADHD people to use.
