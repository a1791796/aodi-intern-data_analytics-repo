How do unit tests help keep code clean?
PyTest is a tool that allows developers to verify that their code functions as expected,developers can catch bugs early and fix them quickly
Unit tests encourages developers to break down code into small, manageable functions that can be tested independently. And small functions will keep the code clean.
Well-written unit tests result can serve as documentation for how functions should behave, making it easier for developers to understand the code.

What issues did you find while testing?
I tried some mathematical functions to do test, pytest did well in spot the error and guide me how to solve it.
