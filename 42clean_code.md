What makes a good variable or function name?
- Descriptive and meaning names
- Avoid abbreviations names

What issues can arise from poorly named variables?
- Poorly named variables can make the code harder to understand.
- If variables don’t have meaningful names, it’s much harder to identify and fix bugs.
  When developers  revisit the code, unclear variable names make it more difficult to debug.
- If you’re working on a team or if other developers will maintain the code later, ambiguous or unclear variable names can lead to confusion 



How did refactoring improve code readability?
By refactoring variables and functions with more meaningful names, the code's content is clearer. 
Using names that are descriptive of the content s with code structure.
When names are clear, identifying bugs or understanding error messages becomes much simpler.
